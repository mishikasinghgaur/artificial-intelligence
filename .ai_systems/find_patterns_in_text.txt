Word2Vec is a natural language processing technique developed by Google in two papers 
published in 2013. It is made up of models for mapping words to vectors of real numbers, or 
for creating embeddings. Word embeddings work on the premise that words that appear in a 
similar context in a text tend to be near to each other in vector space. Using vector 
representations of words in machine learning models has since become a generally 
accepted standard. 

The task here is to perform text analysis on the given dataset of Coronavirus News 
Headlines using Word2Vec model and PCA for data visualization. The goal is to find patterns 
and clusters in the text data that can help in understanding the topics and themes of the 
news articles. The choice of using Word2Vec and PCA is justified as Word2Vec is a widely 
used method for creating word embeddings and PCA is a useful technique for reducing the 
dimensionality of the data for visualization purposes.
